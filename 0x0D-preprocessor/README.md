# Structures : 
A structure is a user defined data type available in C that allows to combine data items of different kinds.

# structure of declaration : 
- you can define a structure in the global scope of your program (outside of all your functions, just like the functions prototypes).
- You can declare elements of your structure in its scope.
example 
"""
struct User {
    char *name;
    char *email;
    int age;
};
int main(void){
    struct User user;
    return (0)

# Pointers to structures : 
To access elements of a pointer to a structure, you have to dereference the pointer and then access to the data using the "." symbol
but : there is a simple way to do that just by using the "->" symbol.

this symbol is equivalent to dereferencing + using "."
